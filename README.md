## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

Wireframing is important because it:
- Clarifies ideas and concepts early in the process
- Facilitates communication among team members and stakeholders
- Helps identify usability issues before development begins
- Saves time and resources by catching problems early
- Provides a clear guide for the design and development process
